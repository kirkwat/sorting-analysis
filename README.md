## Functionality
This program tracks the speed of 6 different sorting algorithms while being used on data sets of different sizes and unique characteristics. There are 4 different data set generation types: completely random, reversed sorted order, 20% unique values, and 30% randomized. The data sets vary in sizes 10, 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M. In the timed tests, the sorting algorithms only sort up to 100K. Once the data sets are generated, the program will run all data sets through each sorting algorithm and display the times to complete them.

## How to Use
This program does not take any arguments or input files. Simply compile and run to generate data sets and have them sorted!
